Given a sorted array of positive integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find three indices i, j, k such that arr[i] + arr[j] = arr[k].
   Given a sorted array of positive integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find three indices i, j, k such that arr[i] + arr[j] = arr[k].


Input format:
The first line contains number of test cases, T. For each test case, there will be two input lines. First line contains n (the size of array).

Second line contains space-separated integers describing array.

 

Output Format:
The output will have T number of lines.
